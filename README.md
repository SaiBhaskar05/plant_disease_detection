# Plant Disease Detection

A Python-based project for plant disease detection using deep learning techniques. The system uses TensorFlow for image classification and disease prediction, and provides an interactive interface using Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies plant leaf images to detect diseases.
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the type of disease affecting the plant.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-powered web app for uploading images and viewing predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow
- **User Interface**: Streamlit

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiBhaskar05/plant_disease_detection.git
   cd plant_disease_detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Replace `app.py` with the actual Streamlit app filename if different.

### Usage

- Open the web interface in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
- Upload a plant leaf image.
- View the predicted disease and additional information.
